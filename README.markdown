# Think your so spacial?

## Briefing.

1. Use h,j,k,l to move cursor around, duh.
2. Use control + h,j,k,l to move between windows.
3. Use shift + h,l to move between tabs.

## Rant against the usual suspects.

You can use some sort of leader mapping to :tabn and :tabp but then you are still stuck having to think about 'next' and 'previous' and then equate that to 'n' and 'p'.  I suppose over time you will eventually get some sort of muscle memory to speed this up.  However as a vim user you should already have the h,j,k,l keys and the directions they take you deep down in your bones. You could easily play video games with the dexterity you have built up with these keys. 

Now if you have all that knowledge on tap on how to get around spacially why not use it to traverse even more space.  Moving your cursor right one character? Use the l key.   Moving right to an adjacent window, use Ctrl-l.  Move right to the next tab with Shift-l.  Same thing going left: h, Ctrl-h, Shift-h. 

This will mess up any mapping that you have for 'H' and 'L' but it's worth it in my opinion.

Somewhat related is the idea of stacking your buffers and using a single windows. I find that having the think of the name of the file is more cumbersome than the sense that I feel when I know the file is below, above or next to where I am at now.
